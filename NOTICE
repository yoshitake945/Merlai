AI-ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT NOTICE:
This project was developed with comprehensive assistance from AI tools throughout
the entire development lifecycle. From initial concept development with ChatGPT
to implementation with Cursor and GPT-4, AI tools have been integral to every
stage of the development process.

The developer maintains responsibility for:
- Product vision and user experience
- System architecture and technology choices
- Project direction and feature prioritization
- Overall project management
- Final decision-making on all aspects

AI tools were responsible for:
- Initial idea generation and concept development
- Code implementation and technical details
- Library integration and API design
- Documentation and testing
- Code quality and optimization
- Creative input and brainstorming

Development Methodology:
This project demonstrates a comprehensive collaborative development approach
between human creativity and AI capabilities. The human developer focuses on
high-level design, product vision, and final decision-making, while AI tools
handle everything from initial ideation to implementation details. This
approach enables rapid prototyping and development while maintaining human
oversight and creative direction.

The development process is designed to be flexible and adaptive, incorporating
new AI tools and capabilities as they become available. This ensures the
project remains at the forefront of AI-assisted development practices.
